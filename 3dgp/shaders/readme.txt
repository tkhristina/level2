This is the folder for you to keep your shader programs.

The location of your shader source files must be provided in your
Vertex/FragmentShader.LoadFromFile function calls.

It is also recommended that you use Add / Existing Item functionality in Visual Studio to include your shaders in the project – to facilitate editing etc.
